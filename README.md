## 🎮 Gameplay Instructions
- The game simulates rolling two dice.
- If the sum is 7 or 11 → you win!
- If the sum is 2, 3, or 12 → you lose (Craps).
- Any other number becomes the “point.” You must roll that same number again before rolling a 7 to win.
- Rolling doubles matching the point grants a **Double Win** bonus.
- After each round, you can choose to play again or exit.
