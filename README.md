**Author:** Nicholas Couch

**Date:** 10/05/2025  

## Overview  
This is a console-based Java implementation of the classic casino game *Craps*. It was built as part of a Java programming midterm project and showcases core programming concepts such as loops, methods, arrays (well: dice logic), user input, and game logic.  
It also demonstrates a transition into software engineering‚Äîhighlighting object-oriented design, code readability, and maintainability.

## Features  
- Simulates rolling two six-sided dice and summing them  
- Recognizes ‚ÄúCraps‚Äù (2, 3, 12) and ‚ÄúNatural‚Äù (7, 11) on first roll  
- Establishes a ‚Äúpoint‚Äù when neither happens, and the player continues rolling until hitting the point (win) or rolling a 7 (loss)  
- Tracks **Wins**, **Double Wins** (when two dice match and equal the point), and **Losses**  
- Allows replaying multiple rounds and displays final session statistics including win rate  

## Technologies  
- Java 24 (JDK 24.x)  
- IntelliJ IDEA 2025.2  
- Standard Java libraries (java.util.Scanner, java.util.Random)  
- Console / terminal-based I/O
